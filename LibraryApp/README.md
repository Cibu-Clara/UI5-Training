### Description:
Create a Book Library application that allows users to manage a collection of books using a local JSON model.
Users can view a list of books, add new books, update existing book details, and remove books from the library.

### Features:

* Display a list of books with information such as title, author, genre, and publication year.
* Allow users to add new books to the library by providing book details, such as title, author, genre, and publication year, through a form. Implement basic validation to ensure that mandatory fields (e.g., title and author) are filled before adding a new book.
* Allow users to update the details of existing books in the library. Provide an edit feature that opens a form pre-filled with the book's current information for easy modification.
* Enable users to delete books from the library, with a confirmation prompt to avoid accidental deletions.
* Add a search functionality to help users find specific books quickly.

### Optional Enhancements:

* Include a detailed view for each book with more information, such as the book's description or cover image.
* Implement local storage to persist the book library across page reloads.
* Implement sorting and filtering options to help users find specific books or arrange the book list based on certain criteria (e.g., title, author, or genre).
